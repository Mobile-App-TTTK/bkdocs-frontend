# Welcome to BKDocs App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project for managing and sharing learning documents tailored for students at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.

## Project Overview

BKDocs is a mobile application designed to help students organize, manage, and share academic documents such as lecture notes, assignments, and study materials. It promotes collaboration among students by enabling easy uploading, searching, and sharing of resources within the university community.

## Get Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready to reset and start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can continue developing.
